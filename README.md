A student issues, feedback and solution system for Chitkara University

## Need Statement & Problem Description
University always makes students comfortable and provide them degree of freedom so that they can share their problems and propose their suggestions regarding the system. Usually the methodology followed is that they put their suggestions into the suggestion box but they never keep track on whether their suggestion is acknowledged or is in process or whatsoever the case may be.

There is requirement of “efficient student feedback and solution system” in which any student can get to check his/her status regarding the proposed suggestion, timely information will also be provided to student regarding how the suggestion is being addressed and what are the possible solutions taken to get it resolved.

### Objectives of the project:
* To provide students with the opportunity to comment on quality of system, its flaws and can provide efficient solutions to improve it.
* To enable students to give feedback and suggestions on various topics and sending enabling them to keep a track of their responses.
* To enable students to contack the university authorities at just a click.
* To enable them to gain more information about the university.
